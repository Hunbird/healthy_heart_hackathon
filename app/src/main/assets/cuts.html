		<h2>Cuts or Lacerations Treatment</h2>
		<p>Take the following steps for minor cuts : </p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<h4>Stop the Bleeding</h4>
				Apply direct pressure on the area.
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Clean and Protect</h4>
				Clean the area with warm water and gentle soap.
				Apply an antibiotic ointment to reduce chance of infection.
				Put a sterile bandage on the area. In some people, antibiotic ointments may cause a rash. If this happens, stop using the ointment.
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Call a Health Care Provider</h4>
				Call a health care provider if:
				The cut is deep or over a joint
				You cannot get the cut or laceration clean
				The injury is a deep puncture wound or the person has not had a recent (within the last 5 to 10 years) tetanus shot or booster
				The cut is from a human or animal bite.
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Follow Up</h4>
				For a minor cut or laceration, remove bandage after a couple of days to promote healing.
				See a health care provider if the cut doesn't heal or shows signs of infection, including redness, swelling, pus, or excessive pain.
			</li>
