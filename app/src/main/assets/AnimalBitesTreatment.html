		<h2>Animal Bites Treatment</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<h4>Stop Bleeding</h4>
				Apply direct pressure until bleeding stops.
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Clean and Protect</h4>
				For a wound or superficial scratch from an animal bite : 
				Gently clean with soap and warm water. Rinse for several minutes after cleaning.
				Apply antibiotic cream to reduce risk of infection, and cover with a sterile bandage.
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Get Help</h4>
				Get medical help immediately for any animal bite that is more than a superficial scratch or if the animal was a wild 					animal or stray, regardless of the severity of the injury.
				If the animal's owner is available, find out if the animal's rabies shots are up-to-date. Give this information to your 				health care provider.
				If the animal was a stray or wild animal, call the local health department or animal control immediately.
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Follow Up</h4>
				The health care provider will make sure the wound is thoroughly clean and may prescribe antibiotics.
				The health care provider may numb the wound and look for any deeper damage.
				If there is any risk of rabies infection, the health care provider will recommend anti-rabies treatment.
				The person may require stitches, depending on how big the wound is and where it is located.
				The person may also require a tetanus shot or booster.
				The health care provider may recommend ibuprofen or acetaminophen for pain.
