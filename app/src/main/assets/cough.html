		<p>
			2016 SEP 28 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Vaccine Weekly -- Data detailed on Bordetella Infections - Whooping Cough have been presented. According to news reporting out of Gujarat, India, by NewsRx editors, the research stated, "Though vaccines have been in use for over seventy years, we have been unable to eradicate or control pertussis. This disease is a worldwide problem, and recently has been occurring in outbreaks even in places with good immunization coverage."
		</p>
		<p>
			Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from the Department of Pediatrics, "The debate about the use of acellular or whole cell vaccine has taken attention away from the other significant issues. The high rate of serious disease and death in young infants, and the repeated outbreaks of pertussis even in highly-vaccinated populations is a matter. or grave concern. Finding strategies to protect the most vulnerable is a priority. Newer vaccines are under development, and will be welcome, but may be too expensive for mass use in resource-poor nations."

			According to the news editors, the research concluded: "It is important to adopt cost-effective strategies to deal with this disease."
