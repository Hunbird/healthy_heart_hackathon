		<h2>Insect Sting Allergy Treatment</h2>
		<p>If the person does not have severe allergy symptoms : </p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<h4>Remove the Stinger</h4>
				Scrape the area with the edge of a credit card or straight edge object to remove it.
				Don't pinch the stinger or use tweezers -- that can inject more venom.
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Control Swelling</h4>
				Ice the area.
				If you were stung on your arm or leg, elevate it.
				Remove any tight-fitting jewelry from the area of the sting. As it swells, rings or bracelets might be difficult to remove.
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Treat Symptoms</h4>
				For pain, take an over-the-counter painkiller like acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Do not give aspirin to anyone under age 19.
				For itchiness, take an antihistamine. You can also apply a mixture of baking soda and water or calamine lotion.
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Follow Up</h4>
				It might take 2-5 days for the area to heal. Keep it clean to prevent infection.
			</li>
			<li>
