		<h2>Treating Fever in Children</h2>
		<p>
			A high temperature can be alarming, but in an otherwise healthy child it usually isn't something serious. A fever often means that a body is working the way it should and fighting off infection.
		</p>
		<p>
			Call Doctor If :
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				You think the child needs medical attention.
			</li>
			<li>
				The child is younger than 3 months old with a rectal temperature of 100.4 F or higher.
			</li>
			<li>
				The child is 3 to 6 months old with a temperature of 101 F or higher or has had any fever for more than one day.
			</li>
			<li>
				The child is older than 6 months and younger than a year with a temperature of 103 F or higher or has had any fever more than one day.
			</li>
			<li>
				The child is 1 to 2 years old with a high fever lasting more than 24 hours.
			</li>
			<li>
				The child is any age with a temperature of 104 F or higher.
			</li>
			<li>
				The soft spot on the child&#39;s skull is bulging.
			</li>
			<li>
				The child vomits repeatedly or has severe diarrhea.
			</li>
			<li>

			</li>
			<li>
				The fever triggers a seizure.
			</li>
			<li>
				The child has a fever and a rash.
			</li>
			<li>

			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			For Infants Younger Than 4 Months Old : 
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<h4>Take Temperature</h4>
				The most accurate way to take a temperature is rectally. If you are uncomfortable with this, then take temperature under 					the armpit. If it is higher than 99 F, then double check it rectally using a rectal thermometer to get the most accurate reading.
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Call Your Pediatrician</h4>
				If the child's temperature is higher than 100.4 F, call your pediatrician.
				Bathing or sponging the child with lukewarm water may help bring down a fever. Do not use cold water, ice baths, or alcohol.
				Do not give any medicine unless discussed first with the doctor.
			</li>
