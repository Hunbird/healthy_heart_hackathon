		<h2>Diarrhea Treatment</h2>
		<p>Treating Dehydration : </p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<h4>Take Fluids</h4>
				Ask your doctor what fluids are best for you or your child. Here are some basic tips:
				Give an adult plenty of clear fluid, like fruit juices, soda, sports drinks and clear broth. Avoid milk or milk-based products, alcohol, apple juice, and caffeine while you have diarrhea and for 3 to 5 days after you get better. They may make diarrhea worse.
				Give a child or infant frequent sips of a rehydration solution such as Pedialyte, CeraLyte, or Infalyte. Do not add salt tablets to a babyâ€™s bottle.
				Make sure the person drinks more fluids than they are losing through diarrhea. If they are unable to keep up with their losses, call a doctor.

				<h4>Rest</h4>
				Have the person rest as needed and avoid strenuous exercise. Keep a sick child home from school or day care.
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Ease Into Eating</h4>
				Feed an infant or child easily digested foods; the BRAT diet (bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast) is a good choice as soon as they can tolerate food.
				For an adult, add semisolid and low-fiber foods gradually as diarrhea stops. Avoid spicy, greasy, or fatty foods.

				<h4>When to Call a Doctor</h4>
				Call a doctor right away if:<br/>
				You suspect that you or your child is dehydrated.
				An infant 3 months old or younger has vomiting or diarrhea.
				There is blood or mucus in the stool, or the stool is black.
				You think the person needs over-the-counter diarrhea medication; some kinds of diarrhea can get worse with anti-diarrheal medications.
				You think the person has traveler&#39;s diarrhea or drank contaminated water.
				The person is taking an antibiotic that may be causing the diarrhea.
				There is stomach pain that is not relieved by having a bowel movement.
				There is any fever.
				The person is losing more fluid in his stool than he can replace by drinking fluids.
