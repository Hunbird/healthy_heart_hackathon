		<h2>NIH begins testing investigational Zika vaccine in humans</h2>
		<p>
			NIH begins testing investigational Zika vaccine in humans. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), 				part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), has launched a clinical trial of a vaccine candidate intended to prevent Zika 				virus infection.
		</p>
		<p>
			The early-stage study will evaluate the experimental vaccine's safety and ability to generate an immune system response in 				participants. At least 80 healthy volunteers, ages 18 to 35, are expected to participate in the trial at three study sites in 				the United States, including the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, MD. Scientists at NIAID's Vaccine Research Center (VRC) 				developed the investigational vaccine, called the NIAID Zika virus investigational DNA vaccine, earlier this year.
		</p>
		<p>
			The investigational Zika vaccine includes a small, circular piece of DNA, called a plasmid, which scientists engineered to 				contain genes that code for proteins of the Zika virus. When the vaccine is injected into the arm muscle, cells read the genes 				and make Zika virus proteins, which self-assemble Into virus-like particles. The body mounts an immune response to these 				particles, including neutralizing antibodies and T cells. DNA vaccines do not contain infectious material--so they cannot 				cause a vaccinated individual to become infected with Zika--and have been shown to be safe in previous clinical trials for 				other diseases.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the Phase 1 clinical trial, called VRC 319, volunteers will be divided randomly into four study groups of 20 people each. After enrollment, all participants will receive a vaccination at their first visit via a needle-free injector that pushes the vaccine fluid into the arm muscle. Half of the participants will receive one additional vaccination eight weeks or 12 weeks later. The remaining participants will receive two additional vaccinations: one group of 20 participants will receive a second vaccine at week four and a third at week eight; the other group of 20 participants will receive a second vaccine at week four and a third at week 20. All participants will receive the same dose at each vaccination.
		</p>
		<p>
			Initial safety and immunogenlcity data from the Phase 1 trial are expected by January 2017. if results show a favorable safety profile and immune response, NIAID plans to Initiate a Phase 2 trial in Zika-endemic countries in early 2017.
